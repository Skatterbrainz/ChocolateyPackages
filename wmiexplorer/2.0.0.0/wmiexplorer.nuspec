    <description>WMI Explorer is a utility intended to provide the ability to browse and view WMI namespaces/classes/instances/properties in a single pane of view and is inspired by the PowerShell based WMI Explorer written by Marc.
		As someone who works with Configuration Manager (SCCM), I spend a lot of time in wbemtest trying to find things which is very time consuming. I started this project with the intention to combine the features of currently available WMI Explorers, and to make it easier and quicker to find what you're looking for in WMI.</description>
